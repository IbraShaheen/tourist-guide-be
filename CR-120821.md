# Code Review - 12/08/21 - @octowl

## Secure Routes

All the routes are currently completely public and don't require any authorization or authentication.
I would recommend securing these routes (or their underlying controllers) soon.

## Models

I haven't used `mongoose` in a long time, can you confirm that the models in the schema are connected to the DB? If they are, how? Witchcraft??

## General comments

All of the changes that were made were because of Prettier.
Please, activate prettier so you don't keep getting huge code reviews.
